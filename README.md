# Simple-Linear-Regression-

- Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables, typically denoted as 
X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable). The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the values of Y based on the values of X.
- Here's a simple explanation along with the formula:
1. Equation of a Line:
- In Simple Linear Regression, we assume that the relationship between X and 
Y is linear, meaning it can be represented by a straight line.
- The equation of a line is 

   # Y=mX+b,

where:
* Y is the dependent variable we want to predict
.
* X is the independent variable.
* m is the slope of the line, representing the rate of change of 
* Y with respect to X.
* b is the y-intercept, the value of Y when X is 0.
2. Goal of Simple Linear Regression:

* The goal is to find the best-fitting line by determining the values of m and b that minimize the difference between the predicted Y values (Ypred) and the actual Y values.
* Formula for Slope (m) and Intercept (b)

3. The formulas for calculating the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) are:
- n is the number of data points.
- âˆ‘ denotes the sum of the values.
- XY is the product of the corresponding values of X and Y.

# Using the Linear Equation for Prediction:
- Once you have the values of m and b, you can use the linear equation to predict Y for a given X:Ypred = mX + b
- In summary, Simple Linear Regression helps us find the equation of a line that best fits the relationship between two variables, allowing us to make predictions based on this linear model.
- The slope (m) and y-intercept (b) are determined using the given formulas.
